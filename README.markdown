Superglue is a lightweight php framework targeted towards predominately static sites that may require 
some dynamic functionality. Developing a purely static site is as easy as coding your template files 
and dropping them in the templates directory. Superglue integrates the Twig templating language, making 
templating a snap. When the need arises, Superglue provides a simple routing and MVC layer that allows 
developers to easily integrate dynamic functionality. Many of the concepts for Superglue were taken from 
the awesome Symfony php framework.
